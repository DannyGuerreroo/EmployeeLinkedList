I started this project by implementing the .csv file import, which was simple enough.

I wanted to use a double linked list for this project, as we had went over it previously in class.
I figured that I should start by coding the linked list, as it is an integral part of the assignment.
I started coding the linked list, and figured that I would add the rest of the requirements when I had the base.
I made the base linked list code off of what we went over in class.
However, this caused some complications when modifying this base for the assignement requirements.

I struggled to figure out how to sort by an employee's first and last name, as I could only get their full, un-split, name from the csv.
I solved this by just storing the current employee input as a node so I could access their first and last name, as the GetName() function is in the Node class.

The sort order of the linked list was seemingly functional when searching by last name,
but in the case of duplicate last names, the first names would make the list not be sorted, as the first names weren't in order.
I tried and tried to get my list to account for the first names if the last names of the current node and input were equal,
but it only ended up causing more problems like other nodes disappearing for seemingly no reason.

My delete function also was not properly working, as it would delete more than just the specified employee's node.

I believe these problems to be caused by an underlying fault in my base linked list code, but
fixing that seems like a monumental task at this point, as I don't have a clue on where to start.

I hadn't done much analyzing of this project before I started, I thought that just making the
linked list and going from there was the best course of action.
I believe this to have hindered my efficiency and success with this project, as I have spent more time
fixing and trying to get old code to work than writing new code, with the new code I write breaking the code that came before.
